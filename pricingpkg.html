        <h2>ST’AT’IMC SELF-GOVERNANCE, SELF-DETERMINATION AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE</h2>
        <p>St’at’imc self-governance and self-determination is something that the St’at’imc have been working on since first contact...</p>
        <p>Summary: The text advocates for the St’at’imc Nation to consider nuclear atomic energy as a means to achieve self-reliance, self-governance, and energy independence. By creating a St’at’imc Atomic Energy Commission and adopting a 7-generation approach, the community aims to build safer and more sustainable energy systems. The author highlights the benefits of nuclear power, including higher energy output and a smaller environmental footprint compared to hydro facilities. They acknowledge the concerns about nuclear meltdowns but propose advanced designs to mitigate such risks. Job creation and economic growth are also emphasized as potential benefits. The text envisions a brighter future where nuclear energy can lead to the removal of existing hydro infrastructure, the restoration of rivers, and the return of migrating salmon to their spawning grounds, contributing to the well-being of future generations.</p>
